tl;dr You may modify this (and distrubute it as such), but don't sell it, kay?

If you happen to meet me one day, you're welcome to also buy me a soda.
Not so much a fan of beer. That or if you wish to support me, please
donate to me so I can continue working on what I love doing: making games.
You can visit https://paypal.me/TurtleP to do so.
